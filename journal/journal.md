### Related project 1 ###
Micro:bit Electro Football 

https://make.techwillsaveus.com/microbit/activities/microfootball

This project is related to my first design concept, because it allows the person to win a game when they've accomplished a series of tasks. 

### Related project 2 ###
Don't touch the wire

https://bryanmmathers.com/dont-touch-wire/

This project made me to realised that I can create different difficulty levels for a project.

### Related project 3 ###
Making a room alarm with your Micro:bit

https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=821&v=igeUhVMqVRw&feature=emb_logo

In terms of the materials and mechnaics of this project, they share basic similarities to my third design concept. 

### Related project 4 ###
Simple Reaction Game

http://web1.muirfield-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/mahara/view/view.php?id=15903

The circuitry of this project is relatively similar to my third design concept, in the way that if the aluminium foil is tapped, the Micro:bit will be triggered and an action will follow. 

### Rekated project 5 ###
DIY #micro:bit Toss Game

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa11moVsfOg

The main elements of this project: aluminum foil, and basic circuitry logic matches my third design concept.

### Related project 6 ###
BBC mirco:bit Electro Fingers

https://make.techwillsaveus.com/microbit/activities/electro-fingers

Same concept but different method and rules as my third design concept. The concept only allows the player to pick up the prize that is surrounded by obstacles using only a picker, whereas, the related project allows the player to use a knitted glove to pick up the maximum amount of prizes per turn.


## Other research ##
<!--- Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it. You should include a reference or link to each of these resources. --->

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
I switched my original idea to contribute efforts in potentially encourage people to stay indoors. Not only this, people attention span will be able to increase and their determination will too as they'll be determined to beat their personal bests. The project will be call Hunters

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
After my assessment 2 submission, I've received a lot of feedbacks that are extremely useful to develop my prototype into a final piece. A large portion of the feedbacks focus on the aesthetic side of my project, while others are on the technical side.
The feedbacks all started with the conceptual prototype forum that I started on L@G, my groupmate was very helpful in suggesting setting a difficulty level for my project. During this stage, I did not think about how my project could benefit from setting different challenges, and what will my users benefit from the game. However, this was quickly all changed when I realised that I could create obstacles using the same material as my project's base, in which the following image will animate this change.

Following my change, I've constructed two lists for Week 10 and 11 of the course, during which I've completed the tasks and goals within the two weeks. The following lists detail all tasks that was set for Week 10 and 11:
Week 10: 
- Set 1:30 seconds for each prize pocket via phone timer.
- If player touch obstacle or foil, they will only have 40 seconds per pocket left. 
- Change from wire jumper that connects to the tin foil base to a crocodile clip to detect the foil better. 
- Add cardboard as base for stronger game. 
- If player touch obstacle, a warning alert will sound, and Micro:bit will start the 40 seconds timer. 
- If player fails to pick up all prizes in 1:30 seconds, put all prizes back in the playing pocket, and restart the game. 
- If player picked all prizes in a pocket in 1:30 seconds, player gets to keep all the prizes.

Week 11:
- Put another A4 piece over the current and design it.
- Conceal most wires using black electricity-grade tape. 
- Design all 4 support pillars.
- Design the outer layer of the pizza box.
- Make obstacles stronger/harder for the player to get the prizes. 

During week 10, I received a feedback from my tutor, suggesting that I could integrate the timer into the Microbit instead of needing to use a phone. Which allows the game to be a standalone experience instead of requiring an external device. This suggestion influenced greatly to my final code for the project, and it was the feedback that allowed the simultaneous timers - where if a player hits the obstacle, a 40 seconds timer will be initiated.

(Talk about the email too, how the email helped to finalise the project).

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->


## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel. This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
